# Calculator

Hello, this is my calculator that I've made for the odin project. 

The thing I worked most on was probably the scientific notation. Other than that there 
were just a million little bugs and quirks to troubleshoot. 

For the design, I was inspired by a calculator design I saw online that had keys like the 
ipad's folio keyboard, which is kind of a weird fabric keyboard with an interesting design. 
I didn't manage to completely replicate it while expirimenting but I stumbled into a 
button design that I liked almost just as much so I kind of gave up on figuring that out
for now. The outset button effect, funnily enough, comes mostly from an inset shadow effect 
on the top and bottom of the button. I first tried using different colored borders like
with the effect that css's outset border has, but it looked too rigid and I knew I needed
something with more of a gradient, bonus points if it had shadows because I could see. 
I asked chatgpt for ideas and thats how I got the inset shadow idea. For the rest of it 
the project's design and and code I tried to stay away from chatGPT and focus on just tinkering
on my own. There were so many cool calculator designs that seemed possible so I want to come 
back to this and try different things in the future.
